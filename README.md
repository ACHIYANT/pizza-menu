## Introduction

In this project, we have created a simple pizza menu interface using React. We utilize components to represent different aspects of the menu, JSX for rendering, and props to pass data between components.

## Features

- **Pizza Menu Display**: The app displays a list of pizzas with their names, descriptions, and prices.
- **Reusable Components**: Components are used to represent individual pizza items, making the code modular and easy to maintain.
- **Props Usage**: Data for each pizza is passed as props to the components.
- **Styling**: Basic styling is applied to make the menu visually appealing.
